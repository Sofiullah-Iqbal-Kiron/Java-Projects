/*
 * Java has 4 kind of bitwise operators: &(AND), |(OR), ^(XOR) and ~(NEGATE)
 * Java stores all the int type data as a bit-string.
 * Java uses 2's complement method to store negative numbers.
 * Left shifting a byte or short value, java compiler will promote it as an int then shift the bits.
 * Each time we right shift a value by one, it divides the value by 2 and discards any remainder.
